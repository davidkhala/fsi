# MX.3
MX.3 is a client/server application based on a three-tier architecture structure
- The application tier contains the presentation layer, business layer, orchestration layer, and grid layer.
- requires high memory, low latency, and high availability
- it can be run on VMs, and no PaaS services are supported for the application (e.g. serverless or container)
  - Hybrid models of deployment (hybrid cloud) for MX.3 are subject to technical review by the Murex team.

# presentation layer
- For added security, we recommend you use VDI running a desktop application to access the presentation layer.
  - you can also access it through a web interface.
